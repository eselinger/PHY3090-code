If this were a real material I would expect the structure to be face centered cubic (fcc), because the energy calculation for that type of structure resulted in the lowest energy per atom of the three. This corresponds to a more accurate equilibrium lattice constant, since this constant should be at the energy minimum.

If the pressure was non-zero we would need the system to be extended in all directions infinitely (i.e. periodic boundary conditions) because with a pressure applied there would be edge effects which would make for an inaccurate energy per atom calculation over the entire system.
